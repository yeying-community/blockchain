//! Reference PoK consensus node for ZhixingGraph (deterministic state machine).
//!
//! This is the on-chain counterpart to the economic simulation (`sim/`) and the
//! ΔK engine (`engine/`): a *deterministic* state transition function that turns
//! a block of submissions into minted/slashed $COG, driven by the SAME B.2.3 ΔK
//! contract (`zhixing_engine::compute_delta_k`). Given identical genesis and
//! identical blocks, every node computes byte-identical state — the prerequisite
//! for consensus.
//!
//! What this layer IS: block/tx/account types, escrow-staked submissions, ΔK
//! finalization, mint/slash accounting, on-chain (outcome-based) reviewer
//! reputation, ed25519-authenticated transactions, a content-addressed block
//! hash chain, a state root, a Merkle-authenticated account state with
//! light-client inclusion proofs, an append-only block log with replay, a
//! deterministic mempool/block builder, a BFT finality core (validator
//! set, proposer selection, verifiable commit certificates), a BFT round
//! state machine that drives liveness under faults (timeouts, prevote/precommit
//! locking, round changes), and a chain driver that strings single-height
//! consensus into a growing, certificate-backed chain — see the sibling modules.
//!
//! What this layer is NOT (yet): real P2P networking — consensus is driven over
//! an in-process message bus (`round::Sim`, used by `driver`) standing in for
//! gossip. That is a later milestone; see README. Money is integer micro-$COG
//! (no floats), so accounting is exact.
