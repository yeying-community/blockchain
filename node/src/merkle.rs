//! Deterministic binary Merkle tree over the node's state — the authenticated
//! commitment that lets a light client verify a single fact (e.g. "account 7
//! has balance B") against the state root without holding the full state.
//!
//! Design choices that keep it deterministic and zero-dep:
//!
//!   * **Domain separation.** Leaves are hashed `sha256(0x00 ‖ data)` and
//!     internal nodes `sha256(0x01 ‖ left ‖ right)`, so a leaf can never be
//!     reinterpreted as an internal node (second-preimage safety).
//!   * **Odd nodes are promoted, not duplicated.** A lone node at the end of a
//!     level is carried up unchanged rather than hashed with a copy of itself
//!     (the classic CT duplication foot-gun). A proof simply records no sibling
//!     step for the levels where its leaf was promoted.
//!
//! This is a plain sorted Merkle tree, not a Merkle-Patricia trie: it gives
//! inclusion proofs (what a light client needs to trust a value) but rebuilds
//! from the full leaf set each block. That is fine for a reference node; a
//! production node with large state would switch to an incrementally-updated
//! trie. Non-membership proofs are out of scope here.
